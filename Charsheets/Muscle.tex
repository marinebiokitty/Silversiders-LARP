Figure out how to be a hero
Social justice for shades and bulbs
Figure out the source of your powers
Figure out who the Peacekeepers are, and maybe join them, depending on what you find
Seek out the Historians to learn more about the history of your world?s racism
Join the Resistance
Use your powers to make things ?right?
See if you can find anything that helps you become a better hero, however you define that
