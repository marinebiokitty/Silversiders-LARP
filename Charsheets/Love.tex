Servant of the Council
Use your abilities to get in the good graces of the Council of Perfection to convince them to treat Shades and Bulbs equally
If that fails, make them sick with love to someone who will never return the feelings
Improve your powers to make this possible/permanent
Don?t actually fall in love with anyone whose intentions are not good, but find love soon (you have the sense that something terrible has the potential to ruin everyone?s love)
Figure out more about why you have powers
Don?t let the Council learn you?re part of The Resistance
You?ve had dreams about a great love, long long ago. You?ve heard the names Arqara and Desiderata. Learn more about it, why it?s relevant still (and eventually do what you can to bring back that love)
(You probably want to talk to the other Historians, but they think you?re a bit silly and useless and will have other priorities)
