Kill the Spider and escape the Spider?s Mind, though you?re not in as much of a hurry as Magnus
Prevent the Savior from being born or find them and kill them
Uncover the history of the old world, find artifacts to save when you escape
Find out about your half-sibling, whose mother was a Bulb, from Truth, and protect them (she?s the Savior?s mother)
Bring various archetypes over to the Dark Side
Unbind your greatest powers
Use your past life memories to find ingredients for a great plague, against the Council?s wishes
Make a plague antidote for your sibling, but no one else matters to you
