Turn down all those who pursue you for love (aromantic, immune to love magic)
Find a genuine friend who isn?t out for a romantic relationship
Social justice for Shades and Bulbs
Recruit for The Peacekeepers
Reach out to the powerful presence of Love in the building to help you find friendship and keep away romantic pursuers
Become known for something other than your appearance. Show them all that promoting beauty is more than just skin deep
Determine whether the beauty of this world is truly gone and worth saving. 
If it?s not, seek the beauty you feel whispering to you in the silence. It calls itself Silverside, and it?s enticing, yet Silverside itself seems almost devoid of beauty at this point. Seek it either way.
