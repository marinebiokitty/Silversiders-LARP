Future mother of the Savior, half-sister of Pestilence
You?re a loner, and so far have avoided joining any groups that have approached you, afraid for yourself and your secrets. But soon it may be necessary to have people on your side. Figure out who you can trust and find protectors.
You know that you have the same father as one of the Council. Figure out which, and whether they want to harm you.
You?re pregnant, but no one knows yet. Don?t let on to the Council. Or any group that would endanger your child. Especially the weird cult you heard is looking for a sacrifice.
You have the strong sense that your child is meant for something important. Find out what, but not at the cost of their safety.
When you find out your child is the reincarnated Savior, join the Historians or seek them out, also the Peacekeepers (but not sure if you trust them)
You have heard whispers of a secret society called the Knights of the Silverside. You feel a sense of danger, or perhaps hope. Figure out who they are.
Social justice? Maybe?
