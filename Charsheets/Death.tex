Kill the Spider and/or escape the Spider?s Mind
Push the balance in your favor and end the world
Research the Silverside
Find the owner of Loyalty and convince them to give it to you? or kill them and claim it so you can use it to kill the Spider and/or escape
Bring your daughter and others to the Dark Side, especially your daughter
Stop the birth and empowerment of the Savior, by any means necessary
Keep your daughter away from Mok
Try to ignore your desire to kill archetypes
Find a good bodyguard for the Council, maybe The Muscle can be turned?
Find out who isn?t loyal to you and destroy them
You have been weakened by something. Reverse it and don?t let on that you?re weakened
