\name{\bCouncil{}}

If you have this sheet, you are a member of the Council of Perfection or associated closely enough with it to know its true aims.

\begin{members}
	\member{\cDeath{}} The Leader of the Council. Archetype of Death. (Perfect, \cDeath{\Sex})
	\member{\cWar{}} The Advisor to the Leader of the Council. Archetype of War. (Perfect, \cWar{\Sex})
	\member{\cFamine{}} The newest member of the Council. Archetype of Famine. (Perfect, \cFamine{\Sex})
	\member{\cPestilence{}} The second newest member of the Council. Archetype of Pestilence. (Perfect, \cPestilence{\Sex})
	\member{\cTraitor{}} A mole acting within groups in opposition to the Council. Archetype of The Traitor. (Shade, \cTraitor{\Sex})
	
\end{members}

\begin{itemz}[Sought in particular by the Council:]
	\item \cMuscle{}: A \cMuscle{\sex} Perfect who failed out of the Academy and tried and failed multiple times to become a masked vigilante on the streets of Silverside. Was arrested in nearly every incident. Usually wouldn't even be considered for any position near the Council, but has manifested some unnatural strength, so \cMuscle{\they} may be useful as a bodyguard.
	\item \cTruth{}: \cDeath{}'s \cTruth{\offspring}. Still at The Academy, but given \cTruth{\their} parentage and budding abilities, which appear to be some form of reality warping, will be a great future member of the Council. However, \cTruth{\theyre} childishly attached to \cWisdom{}, a homeless Shade, and will likely need to be torn from any such loyalties before \cTruth{\they} becomes swayed by the underclasses.
