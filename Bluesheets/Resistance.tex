\begin{itemz}[Sought by The Resistance:]
	\item \cBeauty{}: A \cBeauty{\sex} Bulb who has spent some time in Silverside proper.
	\item \cTrickster{}: A \cTrickster{\sex} Shade who has managed to elude the Perfects until now despite being involved in some likely questionable dealings.
	\item \cWisdom{}: A \cWisdom{\sex} Shade who appears to be homeless. Likely has reasons to hate the establishment.
	\item \cTraitor{}: A \cTraitor{\sex} Shade. Not much intelligence has been gained on this individual, but as a Shade it is worth talking to \cTraitor{\them}.
	\item \cOracle{}: A \cOracle{\sex} Bulb. Lives in the city proper and has few ties to Bulb culture.
	\item \cHonor{}: A \cHonor{\sex} Bulb who is devoted to preserving Bulb culture.
	\item \cTruth{}: A \cTruth{\sex} Perfect who appears to be connected romantically with \cWisdom{}. The \cTruth{\offspring} of \cDeath{}, head of the Council of Perfection. Young and perhaps idealistic enough to bring to the cause.
	\item \cFamine{}: A \cFamine{\sex} Perfect. The newest member of the Council of Perfection. Sources say that \cFamine{\they} have shown potential disdain for the system. Approach very cautiously.
	\item \cPestilence{}: A \cPestilence{\sex} Perfect. One of the members of the Council of Perfection. Sources say \cPestilence{\they} have a half-sibling who is a Bulb. May sympathize with the cause, but may not. Approach very cautiously.
	\item \cOutcast{}: A \cOutcast{\sex} Bulb outcast from even Bulb society. Lives in the Wastes. May know something useful about what exists outside Silverside or general survival. Quite possibly has nothing to lose.
