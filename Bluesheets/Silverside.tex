You know that the world you live in is but one in a vast multiverse. The ancients of your world had seen through the seams of your universe, witnessing the beyond. The layers upon layers of flowing universes appeared silvery on the other side. Thus, it was called the Silverside, the silver on the other side of the universe. 300 years ago, the founders of the city of Silverside knew this, and named the city as a living message to the future, knowing that the right people would ask why. 

Why call the last city on Earth Silverside?

Why would it be necessary to do such a thing?

Because they knew something else about the nature of their own universe and many others. That something within their own world had to be contained, or its effect on countless other worlds could be unimaginable.
