\cIngenuity{}'s Gadgetry Notebook

I'm glad I had a pocket notebook with me when I was arrested. I have the strong sense that I'll find plenty of materials here in this strange complex to produce new gadgets. I'll record my creations here.

(Anyone in possession of this notebook can learn to create these gadgets, but only \cIngenuity{} can open pages.)

Huh, I sense a lot of cool junk calling out to me somewhere around here. Could probably use a \iLockpick{}. Luckily I know how to make that. All I need is a \iMetalShard{} or \iBrokenTrash{} and a separate \emph{sharp} item. The first item is consumed in making the \iLockpick{}, but the \emph{sharp} item is reusable.

(Get a \iLockpick{} item card from the OOG A Packet.)
